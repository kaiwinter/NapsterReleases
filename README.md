# Napster Releases
The official Rhapsody and Napster clients are showing just a subset of new released CDs.
This client shows EVERY single album, EP or single which gets released so you won't miss them anymore.

## Additional features
- Watched Artists: Add artists to this list (right click an artist) to be notified when they publish new releases
- Library: Browse your music library
- Your listening Charts: TOP 20 of your most listened artists and albums

You need a Rhapsody or Napster account to use this application.
